    """Base class for K8s event handlers.

    Implementing classes should override both `OBJECT_KIND` and
    'OBJECT_WATCH_PATH' attributes.
    The `OBJECT_KIND` should be set to a valid Kubernetes object type
    name (e.g. 'Pod' or 'Namespace'; see [1] for more details).

    The `OBJECT_WATCH_PATH` should point to object's watched path,
    (e.g. for the 'Pod' case the OBJECT_WATCH_PATH should be '/api/v1/pods').

    Implementing classes are expected to override any or all of the
    `on_added`, `on_present`, `on_modified`, `on_deleted` methods that would
    be called depending on the type of the event (with K8s object as a single
    argument).
