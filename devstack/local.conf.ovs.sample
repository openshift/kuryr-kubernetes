# CRI
# ===
# If you already have either CRI-O or Docker configured, running and with its
# socket writable by the stack user, you can omit the following lines.
enable_plugin devstack-plugin-container https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack-plugin-container
# We are using CRI-O by default. The version should match K8s version:
CONTAINER_ENGINE="crio"
CRIO_VERSION="1.27"

# Etcd
# ====
# The default is for devstack to run etcd for you. Remove comment to disable
# it, if you already have etcd running.
#disable_service etcd3
# If you already have an etcd cluster configured and running, you can just
# comment out the lines enabling legacy_etcd and etcd3
# then uncomment and set the following line:
# KURYR_ETCD_CLIENT_URL="http://etcd_ip:etcd_client_port"

# Kubernetes
# ==========
#
# Kubernetes is installed by kubeadm (which is installed from proper
# repository).
# If you already have a Kubernetes deployment, you can use it instead and omit
# enabling the Kubernetes service.
# TODO(gryf): review the part whith existsing cluster for kubelet
#             configuration instead of runing it via devstack - it need to be
#             configured for use our CNI.
#
# The default is, again, for devstack to run the Kubernetes services:
enable_service kubernetes-master

# If you have the 6443 port already bound to another service, you will need to
# have kubernetes API server bind to another port. In order to do that,
# uncomment and set a different port number in:
# KURYR_K8S_API_PORT="6443"
#
# If, however, you are reusing an existing deployment, you should uncomment and
# set an ENV var so that the Kubelet devstack runs can find the API server:
#
# TODO(gryf): revisit this scenario. Do we even support this in devstack?
#
# KURYR_K8S_API_URL="http (or https, if K8S is SSL/TLS enabled)://k8s_api_ip:k8s_api_port"
#
# If kubernetes API server is 'https' enabled, set path of the ssl cert files
# KURYR_K8S_API_CERT="/etc/kubernetes/certs/kubecfg.crt"
# KURYR_K8S_API_KEY="/etc/kubernetes/certs/kubecfg.key"
# KURYR_K8S_API_CACERT="/etc/kubernetes/certs/ca.crt"
enable_service kubernetes-master

# Kuryr watcher
# =============
#
# Just like the Kubelet, you'll want to have the watcher enabled. It is the
# part of the codebase that connects to the Kubernetes API server to read the
# resource events and convert them to Neutron actions
enable_service kuryr-kubernetes

# Kuryr Daemon
# ============
#
# Kuryr can run CNI plugin in daemonized way - i.e. kubelet will run kuryr CNI
# driver and the driver will pass requests to Kuryr daemon running on the node,
# instead of processing them on its own. This limits the number of Kubernetes
# API requests (as only Kuryr Daemon will watch for new pod events) and should
# increase scalability in environments that often delete and create pods.
# Since Rocky release this is a default deployment configuration.
enable_service kuryr-daemon

# Containerized Kuryr
# ===================
#
# Kuryr can be installed on Kubernetes as a pair of Deployment
# (kuryr-controller) and DaemonSet (kuryr-cni) or as systemd services. If you
# want DevStack to deploy Kuryr services as pods on Kubernetes, comment (or
# remove) next line.
KURYR_K8S_CONTAINERIZED_DEPLOYMENT=False

# Kuryr POD VIF Driver
# ====================
#
# Set up the VIF Driver to be used. The default one is the neutron-vif, but if
# a nested deployment is desired, the corresponding driver need to be set,
# e.g.: nested-vlan or nested-macvlan
# KURYR_POD_VIF_DRIVER=neutron-vif

# Kuryr Enabled Handlers
# ======================
#
# By default, some Kuryr Handlers are set for DevStack installation. This can be
# further tweaked in order to enable additional ones such as Network Policy. If
# you want to add additional handlers those can be set here:
# KURYR_ENABLED_HANDLERS = vif,endpoints,service,kuryrloadbalancer,kuryrport

# Kuryr Ports Pools
# =================
#
# To speed up containers boot time the kuryr ports pool driver can be enabled
# by uncommenting the next line, so that neutron port resources are precreated
# and ready to be used by the pods when needed
# KURYR_USE_PORTS_POOLS=True
#
# By default the pool driver is noop, i.e., there is no pool. If pool
# optimizations want to be used you need to set it to 'neutron' for the
# baremetal case, or to 'nested' for the nested case
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_DRIVER=noop
#
# There are extra configuration options for the pools that can be set to decide
# on the minimum number of ports that should be ready to use at each pool, the
# maximum (0 to unset), and the batch size for the repopulation actions, i.e.,
# the number of neutron ports to create in bulk operations. Finally, the update
# frequency between actions over the pool can be set too
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MIN=2
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MAX=0
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_BATCH=5
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_UPDATE_FREQ=30

# Kuryr VIF Pool Manager
# ======================
#
# Uncomment the next line to enable the pool manager. Note it requires the
# nested-vlan pod vif driver, as well as the ports pool being enabled and
# configured with the nested driver
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MANAGER=True

# Kuryr Multi-VIF Driver
# ======================
# Uncomment the next line to enable the npwg multi-vif driver.
# Default value: noop
# KURYR_MULTI_VIF_DRIVER=npwg_multiple_interfaces

# Kuryr own router
# ================
# Uncomment the next line to force devstack to create a new router for kuryr
# networks instead of using the default one being created by devstack
# KURYR_NEUTRON_DEFAULT_ROUTER = kuryr-router

# Increase Octavia amphorae timeout so that the first LB amphora has time to
# build and boot
