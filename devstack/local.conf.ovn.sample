# Docker
# ======
# If you already have docker configured, running and with its socket writable
# by the stack user, you can omit the following line.
enable_plugin devstack-plugin-container https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack-plugin-container

# Etcd
# ====
# The default is for devstack to run etcd for you.
enable_service etcd3
# If you already have an etcd cluster configured and running, you can just
# comment out the lines enabling legacy_etcd and etcd3
# then uncomment and set the following line:
# KURYR_ETCD_CLIENT_URL="http://etcd_ip:etcd_client_port"

# Kubernetes
# ==========
#
# Kubernetes is run from the hyperkube docker image
# If you already have a Kubernetes deployment, you can use it instead and omit
# enabling the Kubernetes service (except Kubelet, which must be run by
# devstack so that it uses our development CNI driver.
#
# The default is, again, for devstack to run the Kubernetes services:
enable_service kubernetes-api
enable_service kubernetes-controller-manager
enable_service kubernetes-scheduler

# We use hyperkube to run the services. You can select the hyperkube image and/
# or version by uncommenting and setting the following ENV vars different
# to the following defaults:
# KURYR_HYPERKUBE_IMAGE="gcr.io/google_containers/hyperkube-amd64"
# KURYR_HYPERKUBE_VERSION="v1.6.2"
#
# If you have the 8080 port already bound to another service, you will need to
# have kubernetes API server bind to another port. In order to do that,
# uncomment and set a different port number in:
# KURYR_K8S_API_PORT="8080"
#
# If you want to test with a different range for the Cluster IPs uncomment and
# set the following ENV var to a different CIDR
# KURYR_K8S_CLUSTER_IP_RANGE="10.0.0.0/24"
#
# If, however, you are reusing an existing deployment, you should uncomment and
# set an ENV var so that the Kubelet devstack runs can find the API server:
# KURYR_K8S_API_URL="http (or https, if K8S is SSL/TLS enabled)://k8s_api_ip:k8s_api_port"
#
# If kubernetes API server is 'https' enabled, set path of the ssl cert files
# KURYR_K8S_API_CERT="/etc/kubernetes/certs/kubecfg.crt"
# KURYR_K8S_API_KEY="/etc/kubernetes/certs/kubecfg.key"
# KURYR_K8S_API_CACERT="/etc/kubernetes/certs/ca.crt"

# Kubelet
# =======
#
# Kubelet should almost invariably be run by devstack
enable_service kubelet

# You can specify a different location for the hyperkube binary that will be
# extracted from the hyperkube container into the Host filesystem:
# KURYR_HYPERKUBE_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/hyperkube
#
# NOTE: KURYR_HYPERKUBE_IMAGE, KURYR_HYPERKUBE_VERSION also affect which
# the selected binary for the Kubelet.

# Kuryr watcher
# =============
#
# Just like the Kubelet, you'll want to have the watcher enabled. It is the
# part of the codebase that connects to the Kubernetes API server to read the
# resource events and convert them to Neutron actions
enable_service kuryr-kubernetes


# Kuryr Daemon
# ============
#
# Kuryr can run CNI plugin in daemonized way - i.e. kubelet will run kuryr CNI
# driver and the driver will pass requests to Kuryr daemon running on the node,
# instead of processing them on its own. This limits the number of Kubernetes
# API requests (as only Kuryr Daemon will watch for new pod events) and should
# increase scalability in environments that often delete and create pods.
# Since Rocky release this is a default deployment configuration.
enable_service kuryr-daemon


# Containerized Kuryr
# ===================
#
# Kuryr can be installed on Kubernetes as a pair of Deployment
# (kuryr-controller) and DaemonSet (kuryr-cni). If you want DevStack to deploy
# Kuryr services as pods on Kubernetes uncomment next line.
KURYR_K8S_CONTAINERIZED_DEPLOYMENT=True

# Kuryr POD VIF Driver
# ====================
#
# Set up the VIF Driver to be used. The default one is the neutron-vif, but if
# a nested deployment is desired, the corresponding driver need to be set,
# e.g.: nested-vlan or nested-macvlan
# KURYR_POD_VIF_DRIVER=neutron-vif

# Kuryr Enabled Handlers
# ======================
#
# By default, some Kuryr Handlers are set for DevStack installation. This can be
# further tweaked in order to enable additional ones such as Network Policy. If
# you want to add additional handlers those can be set here:
# KURYR_ENABLED_HANDLERS = vif,endpoints,service,kuryrloadbalancer,kuryrport
# Kuryr Ports Pools
# =================
#
# To speed up containers boot time the kuryr ports pool driver can be enabled
# by uncommenting the next line, so that neutron port resources are precreated
# and ready to be used by the pods when needed
# KURYR_USE_PORTS_POOLS=True
#
# By default the pool driver is noop, i.e., there is no pool. If pool
# optimizations want to be used you need to set it to 'neutron' for the
# baremetal case, or to 'nested' for the nested case
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_DRIVER=noop
#
# There are extra configuration options for the pools that can be set to decide
# on the minimum number of ports that should be ready to use at each pool, the
# maximum (0 to unset), and the batch size for the repopulation actions, i.e.,
# the number of neutron ports to create in bulk operations. Finally, the update
# frequency between actions over the pool can be set too
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MIN=2
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MAX=0
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_BATCH=5
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_UPDATE_FREQ=30

# Kuryr VIF Pool Manager
# ======================
#
# Uncomment the next line to enable the pool manager. Note it requires the
# nested-vlan pod vif driver, as well as the ports pool being enabled and
# configured with the nested driver
# KURYR_VIF_POOL_MANAGER=True

# Increase Octavia amphorae timeout so that the first LB amphora has time to
# build and boot
